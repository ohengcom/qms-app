# Usage Tracking System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

The Usage Tracking system has been successfully implemented as a comprehensive solution for monitoring and analyzing quilt usage patterns. This document outlines the complete implementation details, features, and technical architecture.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 📊 Core Functionality

- **Complete Usage History**: View all quilt usage records sorted chronologically
- **Individual Quilt Tracking**: Click any record to see detailed usage history for specific quilts
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Monitor active usage periods and completed usage cycles
- **Duration Calculations**: Automatic calculation of usage days and patterns
- **Usage Statistics**: Comprehensive metrics including total records, active periods, and completion data

### 🌐 User Interface

- **List View**: Chronological display of all usage records with key information
- **Detail View**: Comprehensive usage history for individual quilts
- **Interactive Navigation**: Seamless switching between views with back button
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Multilingual Support**: Complete Chinese/English interface localization

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### API Endpoints

- **`GET /api/usage`** - Retrieve all usage history sorted by time
- **`GET /api/usage/[quiltId]`** - Get detailed usage history for specific quilt
- **`POST /api/usage`** - Start using a quilt (creates current_usage record)
- **`POST /api/usage/end`** - End current usage (moves to usage_periods)

#### Database Schema

The system utilizes existing database tables:

- **`current_usage`** - Active usage periods
  - `id`, `quilt_id`, `started_at`, `usage_type`, `notes`, `created_at`
- **`usage_periods`** - Completed usage history
  - `id`, `quilt_id`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `usage_type`, `notes`, `created_at`

#### Data Flow

1. **Start Usage**: Creates record in `current_usage`, updates quilt status to `IN_USE`
2. **End Usage**: Moves record from `current_usage` to `usage_periods`, updates quilt status to `AVAILABLE`
3. **View History**: Combines current and historical data for comprehensive display

## 📱 User Experience

### Main Usage History View

- **Chronological List**: All usage records sorted by most recent first
- **Record Cards**: Display quilt name, item number, season, status, and duration
- **Status Indicators**: Visual badges for active vs completed usage
- **Click Interaction**: Tap any record to view detailed history

### Individual Quilt Detail View

- **Complete History**: All usage periods for selected quilt
- **Numbered Periods**: Sequential numbering of usage periods
- **Detailed Information**: Start/end dates, duration, usage type, and notes
- **Statistics**: Usage patterns and frequency analysis
- **Navigation**: Back button to return to main list

### Statistics Dashboard

- **Total Records**: Count of all usage history entries
- **Currently Active**: Number of quilts being used now
- **Completed Periods**: Number of finished usage cycles

## 🌍 Internationalization

### Language Support

- **Chinese Interface**: Complete localization for Chinese users
- **English Interface**: Full English language support
- **Dynamic Switching**: Real-time language switching capability
- **Localized Formatting**: Date/time formatting based on user language

### Translated Elements
