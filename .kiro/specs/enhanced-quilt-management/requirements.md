# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for enhancing the existing Quilts Management System (QMS) to provide improved user experience, better data management, and additional intelligent features for managing home quilts inventory. The system will build upon the existing FastAPI backend and Vue.js frontend to create a more comprehensive and user-friendly quilt management solution.

- **Quilt_Entity**: A database record representing a physical quilt with all its properties
- **Usage_Period**: A time span during which a specific quilt was actively used
- **Seasonal_Intelligence**: System capability to provide recommendations based on seasonal patterns
- **Dashboard_Interface**: The main user interface showing system overview and key metrics
- **Search_Engine**: The system component that handles filtering and searching quilts
- **Import_System**: The component responsible for migrating data from Excel files
