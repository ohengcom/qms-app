# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for upgrading the QMS (Quilt Management System) application's technology stack to the latest stable versions. The upgrade aims to ensure the application benefits from the latest features, security patches, performance improvements, and bug fixes while maintaining backward compatibility and existing functionality.

## Glossary

- **QMS Application**: The Quilt Management System web application
- **Tech Stack**: The collection of technologies, frameworks, and libraries used in the application
- **Breaking Changes**: Changes in dependencies that require code modifications to maintain functionality
- **Dependency Tree**: The hierarchical structure of package dependencies
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript's ability to catch type-related errors at compile time
- **Migration Path**: The sequence of steps required to upgrade from one version to another

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upgrade all dependencies to their latest stable versions, so that the application benefits from security patches, performance improvements, and new features.

4. THE QMS Application SHALL upgrade @types/node from version 20.19.23 to version 24.9.1
5. THE QMS Application SHALL upgrade superjson from version 2.2.2 to version 2.2.3

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and resolve breaking changes introduced by dependency upgrades, so that the application continues to function correctly after the upgrade.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are upgraded, THE QMS Application SHALL identify all breaking changes in the changelog of each upgraded package
2. THE QMS Application SHALL update code to accommodate breaking changes in TypeScript 5.9.3
3. THE QMS Application SHALL update code to accommodate breaking changes in @types/node 24.x
4. THE QMS Application SHALL maintain all existing functionality after the upgrade
5. THE QMS Application SHALL pass all type checks without errors after the upgrade

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that all code is compatible with the upgraded dependencies, so that I can ensure the application builds and runs without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upgrade is complete, THE QMS Application SHALL compile successfully with TypeScript 5.9.3
2. THE QMS Application SHALL pass all ESLint checks without errors
3. THE QMS Application SHALL generate Prisma client successfully with version 6.18.0
4. THE QMS Application SHALL start the development server without errors
5. THE QMS Application SHALL build for production without errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update TypeScript configurations and type definitions, so that the code leverages new TypeScript features and maintains type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript is upgraded, THE QMS Application SHALL update tsconfig.json to use recommended settings for TypeScript 5.9.3
2. THE QMS Application SHALL resolve any new type errors introduced by stricter type checking
3. THE QMS Application SHALL update type imports to use the latest Node.js type definitions
4. THE QMS Application SHALL maintain type safety across all components and services
5. THE QMS Application SHALL use appropriate type assertions where necessary for compatibility

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update API route handlers and server-side code, so that they are compatible with the latest Next.js and Node.js type definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN @types/node is upgraded to version 24.x, THE QMS Application SHALL update all API route handlers to use compatible type definitions
2. THE QMS Application SHALL update server-side code to handle changes in Node.js types
3. THE QMS Application SHALL update tRPC router definitions to accommodate type changes
4. THE QMS Application SHALL update Prisma service methods to use updated types
5. THE QMS Application SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing API contracts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test the upgraded application thoroughly, so that I can ensure all features work correctly with the new dependency versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upgrade is complete, THE QMS Application SHALL successfully run the development server
2. THE QMS Application SHALL successfully build for production
3. THE QMS Application SHALL load all pages without runtime errors
4. THE QMS Application SHALL execute all tRPC procedures without errors
5. THE QMS Application SHALL interact with the database successfully using Prisma 6.18.0

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to document the upgrade process and any code changes made, so that future upgrades can be performed more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upgrade is complete, THE QMS Application SHALL include documentation of all dependency version changes
2. THE QMS Application SHALL document all breaking changes encountered and their resolutions
3. THE QMS Application SHALL document any configuration changes made
4. THE QMS Application SHALL document any code patterns that needed updating
5. THE QMS Application SHALL provide recommendations for future upgrade processes
