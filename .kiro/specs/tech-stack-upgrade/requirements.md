# Requirements Document - Tech Stack Optimization & Upgrade

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for optimizing and upgrading the QMS (Quilt Management System) application's technology stack. While the application is currently functional with modern technologies, there are opportunities for further optimization, dependency updates, and performance improvements to ensure the application remains secure, performant, and maintainable.

## Glossary

- **QMS Application**: The Quilt Management System web application
- **Current Tech Stack**: Next.js 16, React 19, tRPC 11.7.0, Neon PostgreSQL, TypeScript 5.9.3
- **Deployment Platform**: Vercel with automatic CI/CD
- **Database**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety with tRPC and Zod validation
- **Outdated Dependencies**: Dependencies with available updates (identified via npm outdated)
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, bundle optimization, and runtime performance improvements
- **Security Updates**: Latest security patches and vulnerability fixes

## Requirements

5. THE QMS Application SHALL upgrade all other dependencies with available minor/patch updates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the TypeScript configuration and build settings, so that the application has better performance and developer experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript configuration is optimized, THE QMS Application SHALL use modern ES target (ES2022 or newer)
2. THE QMS Application SHALL enable additional TypeScript strict mode options for better type safety
3. THE QMS Application SHALL optimize build performance with incremental compilation settings
4. THE QMS Application SHALL maintain compatibility with all existing code after configuration changes
5. THE QMS Application SHALL have faster build times and better IntelliSense support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the application's bundle size and performance, so that users experience faster load times and better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bundle optimization is implemented, THE QMS Application SHALL have reduced JavaScript bundle sizes
2. THE QMS Application SHALL implement code splitting for better loading performance
3. THE QMS Application SHALL optimize image loading and caching strategies
4. THE QMS Application SHALL implement proper tree shaking to eliminate unused code
5. THE QMS Application SHALL achieve better Core Web Vitals scores

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and resolve breaking changes from major dependency upgrades, so that the application continues to function correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Zod is upgraded to version 4.x, THE QMS Application SHALL handle all breaking changes in validation schemas
2. THE QMS Application SHALL update @types/node usage to accommodate Node.js 24.x type changes
3. THE QMS Application SHALL maintain backward compatibility for all existing API contracts
4. THE QMS Application SHALL update any deprecated API usage in upgraded dependencies
5. THE QMS Application SHALL pass all type checks and runtime tests after upgrades

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enhance the development experience and tooling, so that the development workflow is more efficient and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN development tooling is optimized, THE QMS Application SHALL have faster hot reload and build times
2. THE QMS Application SHALL implement better error handling and debugging capabilities
3. THE QMS Application SHALL have improved ESLint rules and code formatting standards
4. THE QMS Application SHALL implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning
5. THE QMS Application SHALL have better TypeScript IntelliSense and autocomplete support

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement security best practices and updates, so that the application is protected against known vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security updates are applied, THE QMS Application SHALL have no high or critical security vulnerabilities
2. THE QMS Application SHALL implement proper Content Security Policy headers
3. THE QMS Application SHALL use secure authentication and session management practices
4. THE QMS Application SHALL implement proper input validation and sanitization
5. THE QMS Application SHALL follow OWASP security guidelines for web applications

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate all optimizations and upgrades through comprehensive testing, so that I can ensure the application maintains functionality and improves performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all optimizations are complete, THE QMS Application SHALL pass all existing functionality tests
2. THE QMS Application SHALL demonstrate improved performance metrics (build time, bundle size, runtime performance)
3. THE QMS Application SHALL successfully deploy to production without issues
4. THE QMS Application SHALL maintain all existing API contracts and data integrity
5. THE QMS Application SHALL have comprehensive documentation of all changes and improvements made
