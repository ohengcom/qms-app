# Tech Stack Optimization & Upgrade Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines a comprehensive approach for optimizing and upgrading the QMS application's technology stack. The optimization focuses on dependency updates, performance improvements, security enhancements, and developer experience improvements.

**Current State Analysis:**

- Next.js 16 with React 19 (latest)
- TypeScript 5.9.3 (current)
- tRPC 11.7.0 (current)
- Neon Serverless PostgreSQL (current)
- Outdated dependencies: @types/node (20.19.23 → 24.9.1), lucide-react (0.546.0 → 0.548.0), Zod (3.25.76 → 4.1.12)

The optimization strategy prioritizes performance, security, and maintainability while ensuring zero downtime and backward compatibility.

## Architecture

### Optimization Strategy

The optimization follows a comprehensive phased approach:

1. **Dependency Analysis Phase**: Audit all dependencies for updates and security vulnerabilities
2. **Configuration Optimization Phase**: Optimize TypeScript, Next.js, and build configurations
3. **Dependency Update Phase**: Update dependencies with careful consideration of breaking changes
4. **Performance Optimization Phase**: Implement bundle optimization and code splitting
5. **Security Enhancement Phase**: Apply security best practices and headers
6. **Testing & Validation Phase**: Comprehensive testing of all changes
7. **Documentation Phase**: Document all optimizations and provide maintenance guidelines

### Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Updates:**

- lucide-react 0.546.0 → 0.548.0 (minor version, likely backward compatible)
- Minor/patch updates for other dependencies

**Medium Risk Updates:**

- @types/node 20.19.23 → 24.9.1 (major version bump, potential breaking changes)
- TypeScript configuration optimizations (may reveal hidden type issues)

**High Risk Updates:**

- Zod 3.25.76 → 4.1.12 (major version bump, significant breaking changes expected)

## Components and Interfaces

## Data Models

No changes to data models are required. The database schema is managed directly through Neon PostgreSQL and remains unchanged.

## Breaking Changes Analysis & Migration Strategy

### @types/node 20.x → 24.x

**Breaking Changes Analysis**:

1. **HTTP Types**: Node.js 24.x has updated HTTP request/response types
   - **Impact**: API route handlers using raw Node.js types
   - **Migration**: Use Next.js `NextRequest`/`NextResponse` types exclusively
   - **Files Affected**: All API routes in `src/app/api/`

2. **Buffer and Stream Types**: Enhanced type definitions for Buffer and Stream APIs
   - **Impact**: File operations and data streaming
   - **Migration**: Update type annotations for file handling operations
   - **Files Affected**: Import/export services, file upload handlers

3. **Process Environment Types**: Stricter typing for process.env
   - **Impact**: Environment variable access patterns
   - **Migration**: Add proper type definitions for environment variables
   - **Files Affected**: Configuration files, database connections

### Zod 3.x → 4.x (Evaluation Required)

**Major Breaking Changes**:

1. **Schema Definition Changes**: New API for schema composition
   - **Impact**: All validation schemas need review
   - **Migration**: Update schema definitions to new API
   - **Files Affected**: `src/lib/validations/`, all tRPC routers

2. **Error Handling Changes**: New error structure and handling
   - **Impact**: Error handling logic throughout the application
   - **Migration**: Update error handling to use new error types
   - **Files Affected**: API routes, form validation, tRPC error handling

3. **Type Inference Changes**: Improved but different type inference
   - **Impact**: TypeScript types derived from Zod schemas
   - **Migration**: Review and update type exports from schemas
   - **Files Affected**: Type definitions, component props

**Migration Decision**: Due to extensive breaking changes, Zod 4.x upgrade should be evaluated separately and may be deferred to a future release.

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Bundle Size Optimization**:

1. **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based and component-based code splitting
   - **Strategy**: Use dynamic imports for large components and pages
   - **Target**: Reduce initial bundle size by 20-30%
   - **Implementation**: Next.js dynamic imports and React.lazy

2. **Tree Shaking**: Optimize unused code elimination
   - **Strategy**: Configure webpack for better tree shaking
   - **Target**: Eliminate unused library code
   - **Implementation**: ES modules and sideEffects configuration

3. **Image Optimization**: Enhanced image loading and caching
   - **Strategy**: Implement next/image optimizations and WebP/AVIF formats
   - **Target**: Reduce image payload by 40-60%
   - **Implementation**: Next.js Image component with optimized settings

## Error Handling

### Compilation Errors

**Strategy**: Fix errors incrementally by category

1. Address Node.js type errors first
2. Fix React component type errors
3. Resolve tRPC type errors
4. Handle remaining miscellaneous errors

**Approach**:

- Use `npm run type-check` to identify all errors
- Group errors by file and type
- Fix systematically from dependencies outward

### Runtime Errors

**Strategy**: Test thoroughly after compilation succeeds

1. Start development server
2. Test each major feature area
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify API endpoints
5. Test database operations

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

1. Revert package.json to previous versions
2. Run `npm install` to restore previous state
3. Document the blocking issue
4. Research solutions before retry

## Testing Strategy
